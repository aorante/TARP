1 Description:

This software is an AY-3-8910 groovebox, with functions for random generation of 
rhythm and melody patterns.

It is only used for playing live, so it does not contain tools for editing 
sequences of various patterns, or for loading and save them.

Use it in your Jam sessions, add effect generators and enjoy!


The first version (0.9b) was presented in the Karoshi MSX Community eXperimental 
Sound Minicompo 2012 contest.

2 Requirements: 

A standard MSX computer with 64K RAM (or 16K if running from a FlashROM).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 To run:
 
- You can record it to a FlashROM 
- From disk using tools like ODO, loadrom, execrom, etc. 
- From cassette using WAVeR or a similar tool.

4 How does it work?

To start, press TAB to make it generate a random pattern and then press Return.

On the main screen, you will see on the left the control area. There you can 
change the settings using the cursor keys or any of the joystick and activate 
some functions. 

On the right, there is a rotary vumeter for the drum and melody channels, and 
the pattern data is shown below.


The control area is divided into three parts:

4.1 Song:
 
- If you click on the title "Song", it will generate a random pattern, it will 
  activate the Rhythm and Melody channels and if it is not, it will go into 
  Play mode.
  
- Random button, generates Rhythm and Melody patterns.
  
- Play/Stop button, for change play mode.

- Back button, load the previous pattern. 

- Speed controller. It is based on VBLANK cycles.
  1 = very fast; 8 = quite slow.



4.2 Rhythm:

- When you press the title, the status of the rhythm channel changes.
- Random button, generates a Rhythm pattern. 
- Drum Kit switcher. Change between two percussion kits: Standard or similar to 
  the Casio PT series. 

The drums kit is composed of three instruments: Kick (green), Snare (red) and 
Hi Hat (cyan). 



4.3 Melody:
 
Tone generator control based on two square wave oscillators.

Both are enabled by default, but you can disable generator B and modify the 
frequency offset.

It contains a software envelope generator with 8 different waveforms, which can 
modify the parameters of speed or whether cyclical. It also includes a control 
for changing octave (1-6), and a control to increase or reduce notes of the 
pattern.

List of controls:
- When you press the title, the status of the Melody channel changes.
- Random button, generates a Melody pattern.
- A+B switcher, enables/disables square wave generator B.
- OFFS value entry, frequency offset (0 to 255)
- ENV selector, choose from 8 types of wave envelopes. 
  (0 \, 1 /, 2 \/, 3 /\, 4 ¯|_, 5 ~, 6 ¯\_, 7 \-\)
- Speed value entry, adjusts the speed of the wave envelope (1-3).
- Loop switcher, changes the state of the wave envelope loop.

- Octave value entry, increase or reduce octave of the pattern.
- UP/Down note, increase or reduce notes of the pattern.
