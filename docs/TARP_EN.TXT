4 How does it work?

To start, press TAB to make it generate a random pattern and then press Return.

On the main screen, you will see on the left the control area. There you can 
change settings using the cursor keys and activate some functions using a keys. 

On the right, there is a rotary vumeter for the drum and melody channels, and 
the pattern data is shown below.


The control area is divided into three parts:

4.1 Song:
 
Contains the speed controller. It is based on VBLANK cycles.
1 = very fast; 8 = quite slow.


4.2 Rhythm:
Control of the drum pattern. Contains a switch to change between two percussion
kits: Standard or similar to the Casio PT series. 

The kit is composed of three instruments: Kick (green), Snare (red) and Hi Hat 
(cyan). 


4.3 Melody:
 
Tone generator control based on two square wave oscillators.

You can disable the generator B by pressing the "A + B" switcher and you can
modify the frequency offset from the "OFFS" field (0 to 255). 

It contains a software envelope generator with 8 different waveforms, which can 
modify the parameters of speed or whether cyclical. It also includes a control 
for changing octave (1-6), and a control to increase or reduce notes of the 
pattern.
